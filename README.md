## Features
#### Live View:
Your Live view in a pocket-size format. Monitor your SLA and choose among 30+ Key Performance Indicators. Show, hide, drag and drop widgets to organize your dashboard as you like it and change your settings on the go.

#### Call View:
Visualize, search and listen to calls directly from the app. Filter your call list by date range, agents, called/caller number and more. Search parameters are saved and will remain active until you modify or reset it.

Call direction, duration, called number and answering agent are visible in the list. Tap on the play button to listen to the audio recording (a high-speed mobile internet connection is recommended for best performance).

#### Agent Status:
View and filter your agents' status in real time, tap on an agent name to view his personal call and statistics (ie. time spent in pause, call...) for today.
